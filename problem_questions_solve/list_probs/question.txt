Q1. Custom Merge and Sort
You are given two strings of numbers separated by commas:

python
Copy
Edit
s1 = "9,1,6,3"
s2 = "8,2,5"
ðŸ”¸ Tasks:

Convert both strings to integer lists using split().

Merge them using extend() (not + operator).

Sort the merged list in ascending order.

Insert the number 10 at the 2nd position (index 1).

Print the final list.

Q2. Sentence Word Game
Given a sentence input by the user:

"python is awesome and powerful"
ðŸ”¸ Tasks:

Split the sentence into words.

Create a new list where:

If the word length is even, insert it at the beginning of a list using insert(0, word).

If the word length is odd, append it at the end of the list.

Print the final list.

Q3. Advanced Extend & Filtering
You are given a list of strings like:

python
Copy
Edit
words = ["apple", "banana orange", "grape", "kiwi mango"]
ðŸ”¸ Tasks:

Loop through the list.

If a string contains space(s), split it into words and extend the main list with those words.

Expected output:

python
Copy
Edit
["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi", "mango"]
Q4. Custom List Builder
User gives an input string of numbers separated by space:

Edit
lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
ðŸ”¸ Tasks:

Extend the first list with the second and third list (flatten it).

Insert the number 99 at position 3.

Print the updated list.

Expected Output:

csharp
