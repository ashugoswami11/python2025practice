"""   adding items to a list -------------------------------------
method n0.1 append() method -> it adds item in list in the end

syntax:-
list.append(value)
language = ["c", "python", "java"]
language.append("ruby") #append accept exactly on item
# language.append("rust")
# language.append("cobol")
list4 = ["yes","no","true","false"]
language.append(list4)
print(type(language[4]))
print(language)


method no.2 insert() method -> it gives us freedom to add item to anywhere in the list in the beginning or in the middle

syntax:-
list.insert(position,value)

lang_list = ['c', 'python', 'java']
# lang_list.insert(1,'ruby')
lang_list.insert(1,["hubble","bubble"])
print(lang_list)

method no.3 :- extend() method
by this method we can extend a given list to an already created list, because by the use of append and insert the argumented list is seen as an item to the list in which we are passing it

list1 = ["pogo", "cartoon-network", "disnep"]
list2 = ["dell", "microsoft", "apple" ]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

Q1. Custom Merge and Sort
You are given two strings of numbers separated by commas:

s1 = "9,1,6,3"
s2 = "8,2,5"

ðŸ”¸ Tasks:

Convert both strings to integer lists using split().
Merge them using extend() (not + operator).
Sort the merged list in ascending order.
Insert the number 10 at the 2nd position (index 1).
Print the final list.
