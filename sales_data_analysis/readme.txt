This project is a simple sales data analysis project created to understand
how data analysis works in real life.
In this project, I used a sample sales dataset and first cleaned the data
using Python and Pandas by fixing date formats and handling missing values.
After cleaning the data, I analyzed monthly sales trends, product-wise sales,
and region-wise performance.
Finally, I created a basic Power BI dashboard to visualize the results using charts.
This project helped me learn data cleaning, basic analysis, and data visualization using Power BI.
