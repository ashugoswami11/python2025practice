This is a simple Python CRUD application made for learning purpose. 
The project is menu driven and works in the command line. 
It allows the user to add, view, update and delete student records using a database. 
SQLite database is used to store the data. 
This project helped me understand Python functions, basic SQL queries and database connectivity. 
It also improved my logic building and understanding of real world data handling.
