"""agenda :-- to create an attendance system using enumerators,
              A program which contains a list of student iterate
              those student names along with their role number
              and ask student are they present or not and later print all of the list with this information

1. we have list of student
2. we have to show every student name along with roll number
3. ask user whether is he absent or present
4. update student names and absent present remarks in the dictionary{"student name" : "absent or present"}
5.later print that whole dictionary inside a loop and iterate every dict.items() of dictionary
