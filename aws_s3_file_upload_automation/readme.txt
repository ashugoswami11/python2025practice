This is a small beginner-level project made to understand how AWS services like S3 and Lambda work.
In this project, I used Python to upload files into a storage folder which works like an S3 bucket.
After the file is uploaded, a Lambda function runs automatically and processes the file.
I made this project mainly to learn cloud basics, automation, and serverless concepts in an easy way.
It helped me understand how file upload and automatic processing works.
